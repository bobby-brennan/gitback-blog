## Overview
The idea that workers should be guaranteed enough income to fulfill their basic needs
is nothing new. After my home state of Massachusetts began exploring recommended
(non-compulsory) minimum wages in 1912, other states followed suit, with over a dozen
adopting minimum wage laws over the next decade [1].

But the push for mandated minimum wages was not without controversy. The first attempt
to establish a national miniumum wage in the U.S. was ruled unconstitutional in 1935 [2].
Critics claim that rather than boosting incomes, minimum wage laws suppress employment,
ironically hurting the very people they aim to help. 

One solution is to simply do away with the miniumum wage, and have the government
supplement unacceptably low wages. This would allow us not only to ensure that
every worker earns a living wage; it would also alleviate unemployment among low-wage
workers.

Of course, we must consider the cost to taxpayers, as well as the possible distortions
such a policy could create in the labor market. However, as I explain below, the cost
to taxpayers would be greatly offset by the reduced need for social welfare programs
like unemployment benefits and EITC, and a well-designed, gradual implementation
would distort the labor market far less than a mandated floor on wages.

## Benefits
* Full employment
* Employment for the unemployable (elderly, disabled)
* Reduced crime
* New enterprises that exploit cheap labor

## Costs

### Current Programs
* Unemployment benefits
* Welfare and work-for-welfare
The [Earned Income Tax Credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit)
currently distributes over $50 billion anually, making it one of the largest
social welfare programs in U.S. history (though still an order of magnitude
smaller than Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid) [3]. However, it does nothing to
help the unemployed, and an annual 

## Implementation
* Subsidize half way to some number
* Employers front cost
* Govt reimburses via tax credit
* Employees see full net wage on paycheck, are essentially hired for net wage

### Gradual Rollout
* Gradually reduce min wage and increase subsidy
* State-by-state

## Conclusion
Government-subsidised wages present an opportunity to lift the quality of life
for millions of our most vulnerable citizens, as well as boost employment and
productivity. The idea should excite everyone from socialists to free-market
fundamentalists.
