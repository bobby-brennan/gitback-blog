About a week ago, I created this blog. As my first post, I decided
to write about [how I put the blog together](/blog/making-of).  Proud of
my work, I put it up on Hacker News and went to bed. The next morning,
I woke up to this:

---

<style>
  .gif-container {
    height: 400px;
    overflow: hidden;
  }
</style>

<div class="text-center gif-container">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/kzza281.gif">
</div>
